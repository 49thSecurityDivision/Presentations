osintframework.com

Passive OSINT: 
	No direct interaction with the target ==> they should not be a ble to 
	tell you were looking at them
		WOIS Data
		Shodan
		Google Searching
		Public Social Media Sites
		Job Posting
		Internet archives
	
Active OSINT:
	-Active techniques ==>WILL be discovered
	-Extremelu noisy, direct communication with target ==> packets
	-sent to target
		Port Scanning
		Social Media Notifications
		Caller ID logs
		DNS brute force
Semi Passive OSINT:
	-Interaction with the target, but mimicking normal behavior
	-Logs or notifications will be generated, but pass as normal traffic
		Website visit
		Normal DNS requests
		Viewing linkdn (maybe)

Always think: What do I look like from the other site's perspective


Why OSINT?
	 Infosec:
	-Understand attack surface
	-Identify vulnerabilities
	-Help with attack attribution
	-Discover data leaks
	-Helps get a better feel of who the attacker is, theire skillset, etc.

	Business:
	-Vetting potential hires
	-Competitive Intelligencce
	-Fraud or insider investigations

	Personal:
	-Research neighbours
	-Being creepy and spooky
	-Pranks bruh

	Bad usage:
	-Recon prior to an attack
	-Information gatherinf for use in social engineering
	-Phishing targeting/refinement
	-BEC: Business Email Compromise

Understand your footprint ==> know what you look like on the internet
	-Fake data ==> put some fake information out there!

Methodology:
	
	-Measure your time
	-Information discovered through OSINT is often WRONG ==> look for multiple
	sources:
		-WARNING: sometimes those databases cascade from each other
	-Partial confirmations are ok, but be cautious when reporting.

Creating a Research Environment:
	-Virtual Machines: there are OSINT tools out there, make sure to use
	those (and browsers used for research) from a VM
		Base VMs
			W 7/ 8/ 10
			Unix / Linux
			Kali / Buscador
		NEVER use Base VMs ==> clone it and use that (then destroy or copy to hard drive
		Schedule updates, at least once per month.
		Snapshotsa are useful though ==> powerthem off and make sure
		they're all up to date.
			OPSec fingerprint ==> RESEARCH SOME MORE ON THIS
			Use a different VM and destroy it after each individual
		Update tools

	Useful Tools:
	
		Know them, test them, then test again ==> you can never be
		too sure they'll do what you need them to do.
		
	=>>>>>>	-Thread Metrix ==> useful blue team tool
		
		Start with yout favourite one or two resources
		Test something new, then compare results
		Be especially cautious when performing active recon
		
		Active tools:
			-Always test against known data, test data
			-Make testing accounts ==> DONT GET BURNED

		Browser wars: most browsers will do well enough, it depends
		on who your target is
			Epic
			Firefox ==> has a ton of cool extensions
			Chrome
		Use plugins
			Nimbus Screen Capture- Browser screenshots
			Link Gopher- Captures, sorts, and de-dupes all links on page
			Reverse Image Search
		=>>>>>>	Imacros- Automate firefox
		
		You can make your own tools, but they MUST have results that
		can be reproduced ==> screenshot EVERYTHING!

		CHROME:
		=>>>>> hunch.ly ==> best paid tool ==> turn it on whenever,
		then just tell it what you're working on
			Will keep every website you visit on a database
			Fully INDEXED
		Lightshots- Screenshots
		Google translate
		
		BRAVE or EPIC
		Great privacy browser
		Quick dev updates
		Getting very fast


		FIREFOX PRIVACY BUILDS: 
		https://www.privacytools.io/	
	VPNs
		-Always use
		-Mullvad
		-NordVPN
		-Freedome (it's been popped)
		-Decide where the VPN will originate
		-Host machine or Guest Virtual Machine
		-Install VPN software accordingly
	Document EVERYTHING:
		
		-Plan your documentation and organization
		-Take notes constantly, any text editor that's decent will
		do ==> document everything you find on your persona
		-Mind mapping Tools
		ASCII doc
		hunch.ly
	MALTEGO ==> COOL TOOL IN KALI 

OpSec: process of protecting individual pieces od data that could be grouped
to make a bigger picture.
	Who is targetting you?
		Skiddie?, Pro?, Government?
	TEST OPSEC TOOLS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
	WATCH FOR DNS LEAKS ==> set settings manually and test
	WATCH FOR IPv6 LEAKS ==> WILL GO ON PARALLEL OF VPN (DISABLE IT)

VPN COnnection Failures:
	Internet KIll Switch ==> if something stops at the VPN, you'll be alerted/
	connection will be killed
	VPNetMon
	VPNCheck
	Manually Configure OS settings
	Firewall Rules

Webtric Leaks
	WebRTC- Real Time Communication
	Uses STUN to request your actual IP address
		Still broken in current browsers ==> CHECK
panocpclicl.off.org ==> tells you how many LEAK information values your
browser returned to the site. The higher the value, the more uniqeu you are


Browser Fingerprints
	-Every major company does it ==> over 83% of browsers are uniqeu
	Up to 94% run Jav and Flash

	Changing fingerprints constantly actually makes you stand out even more

	AVOID Auto-refreshing sites

		browserspy.dk/browser.php

Search and Logs
	Duck Duck Go ==> browser deicated to privacy
	Make sure you're not logged into google or any other search engine
	
	Consider how your searches will be logged:
		If you go to badsite.come, don't just logg in look for
		a company name and then log out
		Make it look natural 

	Change VPNs from persona to persona, make sure it's not suspicious


Persona Creation and Management:
	Create multpile accounts on each site; LURK hard on each 
	Use different personas / exit nodes for each
	Fake accounts may have legal repercussions.
		-What's the point of your new persona?
		-Does it have to be a certain age, gender, ethnicity...
		-Time zones? 
	
	Pictures help make your account real ==> find, create, or purchase 
	some that will fit your persona's look
		-Avoid stock photos

	Tool: Fake name Generator
		Pixabay.com ==> use outdoorsy, artsy kind of photos
	
	Lunch money pictures ==> extralunchmoney

	Documentation sucks
		Purpose, Twitter, Phone Numver, VPN Exit, Last Name, bday, VM...
		Job, picture, address...
	Password managers like KeePass are usually good, but they also have issues
	
EMAIL
	buy your own domain ==> GMX.com
	Gmail account requires previous account verification
	@mailnator email address, use extra characters to avoid guessing
	cmy*******@mai******.com
FACEBOOK
	Immediately upload stuff
	Immediately join groups, like pages, etc.

	Use facebook games and make some friend through that


AUTOMATING OSINT
	Google Alerts
		Requires google account
		Great for monitoring new mentions of your company's name
		Reuqires yout Google-fu to be on point if it's a common name
			(-) sign will retrieve everything that does not contain the term
	https://Visualping.io
	https://changedetection.com

	Pros:
		Lazy
	Cons:
		Noisy
		False positives
		Require luck

	Tools:
		Datasploit
			Automates collection for
				-Domain
				-Emal Address
				-Username
				-Phone number
			Can be completely passive depending on scan options
			Many API integrations
				Shodan
				censys.io
				Emaiilhunter
				Full Contact
		Spiderfoot

			Great Visulization
			Very responsive dev
			Lots of FPs on large targets
		Tinfoleak
			Social media automation
			No compleat collection, but it provides a baseline
		Birdwatcher
			Twitter information gatherer

Search Engine
	Duck Duck GO
	Bing
	Others

	Safe search?
	Private results ==> creepy, google tracking
	Figure out what seach engine is better for you based on your needs

Know your Operators
	(-) exclude words
	site:

	related: similar, related sites
	
Googel Hacking DB
	Don't use it as a crutch ==> return ridiculous results

Meta Search engines

	Google CSE ==> create your own specific search engine filters

Day 2
_________________________________________________________________________

IOC Pivoting

	Malware ==> common pivot points
		IPs
		URLs
		Strings (functions, comments...)
		Email Address
	Phising emails
		Name
		Subject
		IPs
		Domains
		Attachment Name
Attribution
	Management and employers get really excited, but it's not as easily
	done as it appears to be.
	
Hunting Domains and IPs
	Reverse IPs and DNS ==> Mnemonic, other stuff in OSINTframework
		Pivot to the additional IPs discovered to fin more domain
		names to target
	ViewDNS.info, Shodan (once you have domain name)
	DNS brute force (WARNING: LOUD AF)
		UAT ==> user access test (test server, should not be on
		the internet. If it is, might wanna test it for weaknesses)
	Aquatone
		Open source program, allows you to find IP addresses and 
		perform several recon tasks
IP Tools
	Geolocation (not too accurate, but can be good)
	Blacklists and reputation lists are a good way to determine
	if the domain that you just found is malicious or not
Certificates
	Censys is really good for hunting based on certificates
	Same for crt.sh ==> sometimes gives different results
	so checking it out seems worht it
Googel Analytics
	Often used to track vusturs
	THis ID appends to all the websites you when logged in
	spyonweb.com allows you to look for those in websites
Robots.txt
	Tells search engines and spidets what parts of the web that
	they are supposed to ignore
		-May find hiddden gems
Archives
	Look at previous saved copies of the site
		-Find old pivot data, contact info for previous	
		admins and users, etc.
	Timetravel.mementoweb.org: metasearch engine for archive webs


Hunting People
	QUick seatch accross major sites for registered usernames
	Can get luck nad save a lot of time
	WARNING: some sites are prone to false positives
		Namechk: lots of false positives, but good visuals
		Showem: same
	Github can be used to find technical profiles
	Amazon Wishlist:
		Search by username or email
	General search:
		Run the username through your favourite search engine
	People search engines
		Some are very good, but need confirmation
			NOTE: PAY ATTENTION TO NICKNAMES, SHORT NAMES...
			Phone numbers can be used to attempt to reset password
			USE IT SO IT GIVES YOU THE NAME
			NOTE: SOME PEOPLE SPELL THEIR NAME BACKWARDS

	CUBIB.COM ==> data crowdsourcing.
		Especially for contacts
		YOU CAN CORRUPT THE DATA ON YOURSELF 
	Neighbor.report ==> allows you to put information down on neighbors
	(name, job, address...)

	FACE FINDER ==> FINDS PEOPLE IN SOCIAL MEDIA (RUSSIAN)
	REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH
Dating Sites
	Most are based on geollocation and some sort of randomization
	Can't search directly
	You need to know rough physical location and what they look like
		Match
		eharmony
		Furry Mate ????? LOOOOL
METADATA
	data embedded into images that can reveal some juicy stuff
		-Camera type
		-Geolocation
		-Photographer name / email 
		-Date ....
	NOTE: MOST SOCIAL MEDIA WILL STRIP THE METADATA OUT
Optical Char recognition
	Extremely useful if viewig scanned documnts
	Can be finicky, sometimes won't handle angles or shadows right

Wedding sites
	Are good for finding out a lot of personal information

Fitness Tracking
	good for finding out geolocations and routines	

Tax Record and Property lookups
